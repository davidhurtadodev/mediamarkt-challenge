# MediaMarkt's Carriex

![alt text](./screenshot-markt.png 'Carriex')

The project is a NUWE's challenge and was part of the MediaMarkt Hackathon Let's Go 2023

## Description

The app will help the warehouse team for handling and dispatch the parcels to the carriers. You could add a parcel and assign a carrier. The app will create parcel lists and organize the parcels by the date that the warehouse team has to deliver the parcels. Also, when you deliver the parcel to a carrier, you may enter the carrier's data, validate it and change the delivery state of the parcel.

## Installation

```shell
    git clone [repo]
    npm i
```

```shell
    # Run the server for the initial data
    json-server --watch db.json --port 3004
```

```shell
    # test
    npm run dev

```

## Stack

- Typescript: we use Typescript because we think that coding with Typescript avoids bugs and makes the app safer and robust.
- NextJS: this framework includes React as its rendering library and has incredible tools for routing, optimization and rendering.
- Tailwind: this CSS framework increase greatly the developing speed of CSS styles, and I like a lot its low level approach.
